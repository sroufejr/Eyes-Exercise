# Eyes-Exercise
The goal of this exercise was to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM.  Starting off with just one eye, a function is ran when the body of the page loads which creates a second eye.  This exercise took advantage of "Event Listeners."  As the user moves their mouse around the screen, the eyes follow along.

# Installation
In order to view this demonstration, you will need to "Fork" a copy of this repository you your GitHub. Once you have done that you can "Clone" a copy of the repository to your local computer. When you have the files locally, you can open the index.html and begin using the program.

# How to Use
After opening the index.html file, the second eye will load onto the screen.  From there you are able to see that both the eye balls move, following the cursor.

# Road Map
One thing that I noticed is that when the cursor goes in between the eyes, they appear to just look straight forward.  I would like to see if I can make it so that the eyes appear to cross inwards, similar to what would happen if you were to hold a small object right in front of your nose. I would also like to add functionality that would allow the user to add and potentially remove eye elements on their own.
